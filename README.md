# apiwrapper
The OpenWeatherMapWrapper class wraps the OpenWeatherMap API and provides a get_current_weather method that returns the current weather for a given city. The method takes care of constructing the appropriate API endpoint and parameters, and parses the response into a more user-friendly dictionary format. You need to provide your own OpenWeatherMap API key to use this wrapper.
